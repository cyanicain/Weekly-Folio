TO BE SICK

He looks around like he is trying to find any other possibility for you to be holding a knife to your chest 

Any other reason for there to be a bottle of drain cleaner half empty on the desk in the same place where you keep your flask

The whole room reeks of acid 

You’re stripped down to your singlet and trousers, painted in the liquid toxicity, face red and burning and breathing in a way you shouldn’t be 
And he is looking at you as if he can’t.


He looks at you like he is going to be sick 
Sick in the way he used to look when his fever rose and rose until he was incapable of speaking

Of doing absolutely anything but force oxygen between aching lungs and airways that crumbled in on themselves as they filled with fluid and blood. 

He’s maybe even the type of sick he still gets sometimes 

When his head is too empty and his body goes numb as if covered in ice and snow

When the oblivia eventually reaches into his golden heart like a poison. 

He never tells you these things anymore, 

But the weight of his mind sometimes bleeds into the features of his unfamiliarly familiar face

The shaking gentleness of his scarred hands

The three AM song of your name from the gravity of his tongue when you are screaming at the moonlight

Seeing phantom relics of needles and knives and tubes and blue liquid made of tree sap and blood, 


... – ? What the fu… – oing?

His voice is strange 
 
His face is strange, his hands, his body. 

You know it is him, you do, you really, really do 

But even so, you still want to shrivel yourself into the corner of the room and count numbers on your fingers until you reach infinity; 

You want to tear the flesh from the bones of your body until dawn rises above the mountains

You want to scream the syllables of your name beacue don’t think they exist anymore

Died somewhere in-between the fever


Maybe it is you who is the stranger.

Maybe you are the one who's sick. 


There’s a knife to your chest

half a bottle of drain cleaner within your stomach 

And a rifle that sits to your left that is slowly whispering harmonic whispers of rapture and mockery in the same breath

And yet, the lively heart beating inside your chest seems to defy it all. 


Thump, thump, thump.


– ...‘Ife down! – lease, – can you give m –


It keeps playing
 
Over and over again like a record on a loop that he and you had danced to the night before you left 

And it was impossible to stop. 

Not the needles or their teeth

Not the slashing of your paper skin 

Or the half-bottle of acid you choked on could silence the pounding rhythm inside your chest It played on endinglessly, eternally like a damned infinite siren

It isn’t like you wanted to die, but you are terrified of what should happen if you don’t


I said get the fuck away from me.


You are sick

Probably very sick in all the ways most people never would be

But you’re also alive 

Vividly, eternally alive 

And you think after the knowing the taste of your own teeth, 

Knowing to love with crystalline molars and their fever

That’s entirely the problem

Living is a disease all the same, and you are going to live for a very, very long time. 


The drain cleaner is sugar syrup and sweet honey

The combat knife is the starry reflection of the ever-changing sky

The glint of daybreak in the morning

The gun is a children’s toy loaded with a pebble. 


You'r… – goin to ki – …yourself!


No. You can do no harm.


The knife is twisting within your skin

Cutting as if it is paper because it is

You’re a doll made of newspaper and cotton

Of buttons and twine

And though you used to have skin

It is all rotten now

You’re porcelain

You’re perfect


Your voice, your hands are steady because they are not your own

They’re teeth, and you love with them as hands do

Your mouth and its sharp poetry was made for him 

You know this now and you have since the fever

Since your crimson organs were buried with cyanic syrup and turned acidic purple


He is wrestling you for the knife now

It shouldn’t matter whether or not he succeeds

You can feel the foreign acid devouring the flesh and bone from inside your stomach like butterfly kisses

It does matter because you can feel your organs expelling the toxin

Rrestitching the unblemished porcelain of your physical soul together

And tthat’s not right.


As you speak, clear burning liquid that smells of your mother’s cleaning closet runs

Down your mouth, your neck, over your fevered teeth like the all the poetry you’ve 

Never written for him 

You choke on it, but you never stop breathing. 


You should count them. Each breath.

You do.


Oh, God. Okay, fuck. C – you ple... gi – me the knife, plea –


He wins

He wins a lot now, lately

He has the knife and holds it so tightly that the middle of the blade presses into the palm

Of his hand and makes it bleed onto the floor

He re-adjusts his grip and heals


You stare at the stranger and wonder if you should ask him if he is thirsty

You wonder if he has a fever


The clear liquid death staining upon the skin of your neck feels as if it is gone

Evaporated into the January mountainous snow like snowflakes in the spring

The gun in your hand, metal kissing against the rose blush of your lips is the feeling of 

A thousand suns’ warmth upon this desolate Earth 

And you burn


Or at least, you should be

This close to your beautiful, disintegrating brain filled with syrupy blue medicine 

That gives you the power to live forever


I kno… ey messed with y –, okay? ... Did awf – ucking shi – nd I am so, s ... – rry that I couldn  – ... stop it….cky, but if you d ... this, you will actu – die. Jesus, y – onna kil… rself! Ple – just...


You're not listening. I can't die. 
 

Your organs are all cleansed now

Nothing smells of bane

The air is crisp outside and has the aroma of an oncoming snowstorm.

Maybe tomorrow or the day after.


... don’t –

It’s okay.

Watch.

N ... – !


Oh, you think as he screams. 

Oh, you think as your brain builds itself back together 

And you remember who you are

What you are.


You don’t try again until the snowstorm covers the skies 

And everything is blackened with pale white light 

And frostbitten water suffocating the earth. 


Oh, you think as he screams for the second time.

Oh, you think as you fall in love with the Earth

You fall faster than the snowflakes do when they rain down upon the earth

In all their crystalised angelic glory

Because of course you do. 

You are an undead weight of porcelain flesh and amber bone marrow and acidic drain Cleaner
That doesn’t deserve to be among the wreckage of winter snow and broken poetry when the Cathedral you condemned yourself to comes tumbling down along with the fever


Screams from a bloodied, mangled throat become that of manic hysteria

Complete insanity as your undead corpse of all things inhuman hits the burning ice

Shattering the bones of your vertebrae

Painting the clean ice with gallons and gallons of bleeding crimson unlife


Ha.


You laugh in some deranged, knowing way

A bubbling crackle of broken teeth and bloody vomit from the back of your throat 

It tastes like him

You feel your own corpse rebuild itself back together like a needle and thread

Like brain matter and memory.


You can do no harm.

You will come to know that it is never you who will have the privilege to hurt yourself

You will not be thankful.

Because – 


The drain cleaner is sugar syrup and sweet honey

The combat knife is the starry reflection of the ever-changing sky 

The glint of daybreak in the morning

The gun is a children’s toy loaded with a pebble. 


The fall is freedom. The ice is sleep.
