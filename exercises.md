**WEEK 1**

The type of writing I do revolves around a combination of poetry and short fiction. It’s almost long-form prose that crafts a narrative through thousands of words. It probably awfully pretentious and then frustratingly complex, but I want every line in my shorties to feel like poetry. The literally aspects I encompass when I write include allegories and metaphors, mostly. I like to allude to other things that mean other things within my writing. I like it to feel as if I am talking about anything else than the thing I am actually talking about. I often confuse myself and wonder what the fuck it is that I am actually trying to say. 

These analogue techniques constrain my writing as it makes it too abstract. I understand that to resonate and alter and inspire the readers who view my work, it needs to be understood; yet how am I supposed to do that when I don’t even know what it is I’m writing about? I want the contemporary aspect of digital writing to force be away from my complicated intricates of metaphorical pieces, and create something that is complex, yet in a different way – whether that be form, production, layout, interactivity. Professional, I would describe my author's biography as such: Chay Newman lives and works in Melbourne. She is currently studying creative writing at RMIT. In 2022, she published work in RMIT’s student magazine ‘Catalyst’, AFIRC's 'Best Australian Films You've Never Seen', and a self-published anthology book titled ‘Hurt and Comfort’. Inspired by the likes of Caitlyn Siehl and Emily Dickenson, Chay focuses on epic poetry and long-form prosaic stories.

The digital techniques I've utilised most are simply word doc and google docs, however I have utilized a video editing software, 'Final Cut Pro' to create poetry in the form of video art. I've done this to create a more immersive experience to the 'experiencer' rather than the 'reader' of my work. Video art poetry can incorporate sound and visuals rather than just words, compared to tradition print poetry.

Thinking about my final digital piece, I've begun experimenting with Twine. I will admit, I am very technologically challenged, and so anything remotely related to coding scares the shit out of me. Twine, however, I have found very accessible and user-friendly. I've begun adapting a previously written print poem into a digital format. It was a linear structure and isn't 'choice-based', and so I thought adapting it digitally would keep it fairly the same. I didn't expect for my original piece to change so drastically, but it has. The original dark and horror-esque poem is written from the second-person perspective, and is about you, coming to the terms that you are suddenly immortal and wanting nothing more than to 'test' your newfound immortality by attempting to kill yourself when you know you can't, all the while your lover (who doesn't know any of this) watches you. First off, the narrative is no longer linear. I've added passages where the 'user' reading the poem can go back an explore different choices. I've also added narrative choices such as forth-wall breaks where you (the user) can break away from the narrative and ask questions like "WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?". Experimenting, with a digital format has also allowed me to colour the background and change the colour of the text in certain passages, such as a bright, stark red as a sort of 'danger' sign within the poem.

All of these digital aspects that I have experimented with in Twine has transformed my original print poem, which I had thought would, for the most part, stay the same. The non-linear format and repeat of passages has given my poem a deeper sense of horror and delve into insanity; the digital formatting of the page evoking a stark constract to my poem's original conception and form; and the breaking of the fourth wall speaks directly to the user and alters the reader-writer-text partnership, furthered by the user's interactive with the fiction.

**WEEK 5**

Outside of Twine, I have also been expirementing with 'Final Cut Pro', a video editing software that I am very familiar with. I began using FCP in 2016 and contiuned going so up until 2021. Throughout highschool, I loved creating little movies and videos, then experimenting with what the internet valls 'edits'. Edits are fan-made videos/clips of an original media (whether that be a TV show, movie, anime, celebrity etc) that are quite populare in fandom culture and spaces on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok etc. I, for once, began creating edits to Star Wars, and did so for years (with various other medias) which inspired my love of video craft and editing. Thinking about digital writing and poetry has urged me to wonder if I could create a video piece using FCP, and so, I have expiremented with making a digital text message exchange. Differing from my original print poem reinvented cia a digital form, this work is conceptualised to be entirely digital. I want to make a video of a text message conversation playing out of a person calling in sick to work, with each text bubble appearing one after the other, mimicing real life. To do this, I started with a white solid-colour background. I downloaded a blank iMessage text bubble image, when added that it, while creating my own text within it, laying the text over the top of the image. I then animated it to 'pop up' the way it would on a phone, repeating the process for subsequent text messages with a slight 'typing' delay. Finally, I added both an iPhone keyboard typing and 'ding' sound effect with each new message. 

Overall, this created a short video of an edited recreation of a text message conversation. <img width="404" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 7 42 28 PM" src="https://github.com/cyanicain/Weekly-Folio/assets/163791115/755da4e8-2776-4f6d-b3b6-fa204753cfc6">


**WEEK 6**

Working with FCP, however, has its limitations. For once, being a video, the narrative is completely linear. It is in me (the creator) to decide exactly where I want the reader/veiwer to end up, leaving no room for user agency or interaction besides the decision to click 'play' on the video. At the end of the day, my digital work would just be one video of a conversation playing out, and while that is still digital writing, it doesnt encompass the reader-writer-text relationship that I want to convey, nor leave any room for non-linerarity and choice for my users to experience, a huge part of what makes digital writing digital writing. 

So, while scary and intimidating, I have returned to Twine to create a non-linear narrative to my story via three pathways that the user can playout while interacting with my piece. This encompasses the 'game-like' element while reflecting the user-based interative method of changing the dynamic between a text, the author and the experiencer. It makes it more personal than simply watching a video play out if *you* yourself are having a direct impact on the story you are reading. 

**WEEK 7**

‘How to Call in Sick’ is an interactive story-choice game designed to simulate you, the employee, messaging your manager to let them know that you will not be able to come in today, due to being sick. In this case, you have suffered a server anxiety attack and suicidal ideation, and so, going to your 13-dollar-an-hour job at McDonald’s, doesn’t seem like the mentally healthy thing to do today.

The game starts with recounting your morning, and then presents you with three main options on how you want to go about calling in sick, with each pathway designed to be a 5-minute playthrough accounting for each sub-choices that arise in the various interactions you can have with the manager. Its digital design emulates a text message conversation, while each option is a text that is sent by you, while the subsequent manager’s messages change based on your own. This lets you, the player, change the story’s outcome, like you would in a realistic conversation to your boss, and reflect on what the true ‘good’ ending is as you play through it.

The first option is [[tell your manager about your crippling anxiety]]. In this one, you are honest, adapting your usual people-pleaser and apologetic demeanour towards your own mental illness and the fact that you cannot work despite having a very valid reason to not. A sub-choice that presents itself in this pathway is telling the manager your anxiety thoughts while still using your polite, nonconfrontational-attitude, to which they will dismiss you anyway. It ends with you either agreeing to go to work, where your objective: call in sick for work, has failed; or starting the day again.

The second option is [[keep it short because you don't owe her shit]]. In this one, you admit you are taking a sick day without letting your manager know why. The manager gets more and more frustrated with your lack of ‘honesty’ and calls you out on the fact you aren’t physically sick. You are staying true to yourself in this one, refusing to bend to a toxic work lifestyle that is putting your own mental health in jeopardy, yet your ‘insubordination’ gets you fired. You’ve achieved your objective, but at what cost? At this point game lets you play again, because maybe getting fired and having no income wasn’t the best outcome for you.

The third option is lying. You don’t think your manager will see ‘mental health’ as a valid reason to miss work, and so you tell them you are in the hospital instead. They ask for proof, for a medical certificate, or a picture of yourself in the ward, and so, you decide the only way to save your job is to actually put yourself in the hospital. You purpose break your arm, again completing your objective, but at what cost? And if you are willing to do such a thing to proves that you are sicker than you, does that not make you even more mentally worse? 

All in all, there is no ‘good ending’ no matter how many times you replay the day and start the conversation different and choose different messages to send, despite the multiple endings. This game is designed to highlight the flaws in modern workplaces and how mental health is never seen as a good enough excuse to take time off or call in sick. Work has become the most important thing in our lives because our livelihoods are entirely dependent on us earning an income. With the way our world is structured, we wouldn’t be able to live with one. It’s terrifying how far people of the system have to go to, either, a) hurt themselves further to be taken seriously by proving they are ‘sick enough’, or b) let their health suffer as a result regardless if the illness is mental or physical. Workers are forced to make this unhealthy and toxic ultimatum, because the only other choice is to lose their job, sacrificing income, housing, food, education etc. If I were to link this small choice game back to the ideology, it would be that this capitalistic-like life-revolves-around-work mentality is deeply flawed. I want to aim to highlight its absurdity, its inequality, and inhumane-nature, urging the those who have to work in these conditions to rethink how they view their own work-balance and that is affecting their own wellbeing; as well as, the ‘problem’ -- people in power who lack empathy and reasoning, and are continuing to fester this toxic ideology that work is everything at the expense of everything else.


**WEEK 8**

Something that I have decided to expand upon in my piece is the deteriorating mental health epidemic that has become 'unimportant' in the eyes of this toxic work-over-everything mentality. Through my piece, I want to highlight the insanity that is this mentality and how little work should matter in the grand scheme of things as it is absurd how people have to resort to destroying themselves in order to feed, cloth, and house themselves. No, I do not think that nobody should work and that society would be better off without the concept, as that idea is immature, unrealistic and not something I want to convey; but am I expressing that work should not be *everything.* To do this, I've included a fourth pathway to my original three. The fourth storyline option is simple. The choice that can be made is: kill yourself. In that option, your manager with ring you continuously, while berating you via text messages for ignoring them and not showing up to work, without you ever responding, unlike the other pathways. It ends with your manager telling you 'you better be dead to have missed work like this', and then having the option to start the day again. While dark and confronting, this pathway explores the worst-case scenario of toxic work-life ideology and puts into perspective how insane this capitalistic mindset truly is. It acts as a warning to those who push this unachievable, mental-health-compromising idea that work = everything above even yourself. Forcing users to experience this awful scenario over what could happen should someone act on suicidal ideality because of the system's lack of ability to care about anything other than work, demonstrates the main contention of the peace: people in power who lack empathy and reasoning, and are continuing to fester this toxic ideology that work is everything at the expense of everything else, especially, the very people of the system who are dedicating their wellbeing to work for them. 

**WEEK 9**

A really big inspiration for this piece is the 2015 indie game titiled 'Emily is Away'. It is set entirely through early 2000s MSM messages, as you, the protagonist, keep in contact with your friend, Emily, over the course of a few years – from your final year of high school through to college. As you each move into diffent states of your lives, you experience growing apart, disconnecting, and becoming strangers dispite once being best friends who could have, if things turned out differently, become something more. A really intresting aspect of the game is that, dispite your choices of conversation throughout the years, you will drift apart no matter what; and once you finally choose to confess your feelings and the game will not obey and instead talk to Emily about meaningless things likes the weather. This choice-based game is, ironically, not one and instead gives you the illusion that your actions matter; but no matter how hard you love her, you cannot stop yourself from losing Emily. It isn't either of your faults, it is just life. Sometimes, despite it all, you do not get to choose. 

I want to emmulate this idea in a similiar way. Despite having three different main pathways, I want each those endings to be unfulfilling and pessimistic. Any way you go, it is a lose-lose situation, giving you the illusion of choice. This will be done to reflect back to the nature of my piece about the toxicity of work culture on mental health, and the unfairness it has on people of the system. Yes, you can call in sick, but then you loose your job. Yes, you can go to work, but then your health deteriorates. Yes, you can injure yourself to seem 'sick enough', but only at the cost of hurting yourself. Despite having all these choices, you cannot win. *This* is a broken and deeply flawed ideaology and system that needs to be changes.

**WEEK 10**

The feedback I have received from my proposal urged me to further experiment with Twine to really evoke the feeling of a phone text conversation within my audiences as they experience my digital piece. I first began by incorporating a bubble-like structure to the dialogue within my story in order to appear more like 'text messages'. I did this by creating a box border around the entire dialogue to seem like a text bubble sent from a phone. I further added to this text-phone conversation immersion by having one person's bubbles on the left side of the screen, while the other's appears on the right, mirroring a text conversation in apps such as iMessage and WhatsApp. In my piece, "your" (the protagonist's) text messages are on the right as to create a feeling that they are coming from you (the user) directly, while "manger" (the antagonist) messages are on the left. Overall, this was done to create the feeling that the user is truly having a text conversation as they play the game. I want to place my audience directly into my protagonist's world, and simulate what this interaction would be like as they text their manager to call in sick. It furthers the realism and suspension of disbelief if my piece not only looks like a text conversation but *feels* like it too, all in all, contributing to the contention that this could and is happening to people of today's workforce.

**WEEK 11**

Adding to last week's experimentation of making my piece emulate a text message conversation, I have added a phone-ringing sound effect to my final pathway. In this pathway, the manager calls you, while you do not answer, and so the phone just rings out throughout the whole pathway. Learning to do this was honestly more difficult than I would like to admit. I started by searching out 'how to add sound effects into twine story' into Google, and after scouring several different forums, I realized I needed to upload my sound file (which I had downloaded from the internet) into a website that could host it, copying the URL into Twine. I tried both OneNote and Dropbox, but it wasn't until I uploaded it to Wix of all things that it actually worked. I added the sound effect to the entire fourth pathway, not just the two first 'incoming call' phone notifications, as I wanted to make it out that the manager, while texting you, was also calling you endlessly at the same time. The only time the manager stops calling you is to message you 'you better be dead to have missed work like this', as by that time, I really want for the user's attention to be entirely focused on that last line.

Similarly, with adding an audio file, I have also added images as well. The image (used multiple times in one of the pathways) is of a hospital waiting room hallway that I found by searching 'hospital waiting room Snapchat' of all things. Adding the word 'Snapchat' allowed me to find a first-person, low-quality image someone had taken of an actual hospital waiting room, rather than a professional landscape photograph of a hospital waiting room. As the image is supposed to simulate an actual person taking a photo while they wait in the hospital emergency room, this worked perfectly. I further made this image look like a sent text message just as I did with the dialogue, encasing it in a boarder while centering it to the right of the screen to look as if sent by 'you'.
