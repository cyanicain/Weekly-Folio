WEEK 1

The type of writing I do revolves around a combination of poetry and short fiction. It’s almost long-form prose that crafts a narrative through thousands of words. It probably awfully pretentious and then frustratingly complex, but I want every line in my shorties to feel like poetry. The literally aspects I encompass when I write include allegories and metaphors, mostly. I like to allude to other things that mean other things within my writing. I like it to feel as if I am talking about anything else than the thing I am actually talking about. I often confuse myself and wonder what the fuck it is that I am actually trying to say. 
These techniques constrain my writing as it makes it too abstract. I understand that to resonate and alter and inspire the readers who view my work, it needs to be understood; yet how am I supposed to do that when I don’t even know what it is I’m writing about? I want the contemporary aspect of digital writing to force be away from my complicated intricates of metaphorical pieces, and create something that is complex, yet in a different way – whether that be form, production, layout, interactivity. Professional, I would describe my author's biography as such: Chay Newman lives and works in Melbourne. She is currently studying creative writing at RMIT. In 2022, she published work in RMIT’s student magazine ‘Catalyst’, AFIRC's 'Best Australian Films You've Never Seen', and a self-published anthology book titled ‘Hurt and Comfort’. Inspired by the likes of Caitlyn Siehl and Emily Dickenson, Chay focuses on epic poetry and long-form prosaic stories.

The techniques I've utilised most are simply word doc and google docs, however I have utilized a video editing software, 'Final Cut Pro' to create poetry in the form of video art. I've done this to create a more immersive experience to the 'experiencer' rather than the 'reader' of my work. Video art poetry can incorporate sound and visuals rather than just words, compared to tradition print poetry.
